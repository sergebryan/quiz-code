We're going to create a code quiz using JavaScript. The quiz will be be timed, the user will have 60 secondes
to complete the quiz. The quiz is a set of questions with multiple choices, the user will have to choose the correct
answer out of four choices. When the user clicks on an answer, the page will say "correct" if it's the right choice or "incorrect"
if it's the wrong answer. After the user will click on an answer, it will go to the next question until the user answers all questions.
At the end of the quiz, the game will show the score and then will ask for the user initials. When the user put its initials and clicks
submit, it will display user initials and user score. When the user repeats the game multiple time, it will display the user score from 
highscore to lowerscore.
